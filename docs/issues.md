|1|Robot battery|searching| June,17th,22 |Use 60V battery of VinFast for robot|Large voltage meaning low current, that why they use high voltage for the eletric car or bike, due to large torque problem you need large current then the battery volume need to be large too, we use voltage adapter to convert 60V to any lower range like 24V or 12V but be sure the circuit can handle well |Voltage adapter|
